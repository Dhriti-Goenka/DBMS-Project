# DBMS-Project
Tourism Guide Database

This is a team project in which we tried to create and implement a database for an online tourism website that allows users to search for destinations, book hotels online, and access various other features such as searching based on ratings provided by other tourists, comparing hotel prices, and so on.

We were inspired by the Gujarat Tourism website, which is a beautifully designed platform that allows for easy searching and booking of tourist attractions, among other features.

We restricted ourselves to a small number of locations due to the extreme diversity of the data to simplify the design and streamline the highly complex implementation. We've also added a few keys, such as Customer ID, Hotel ID, and Room ID, to improve application accessibility and query solutions.
